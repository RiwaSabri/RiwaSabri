# Hi there, I'm Riwa!

Here, you'll find some of the data science projects I worked on as part of the Metis Bootcamp. 

## [A completely new way of discovering interesting tweets!](https://github.com/riwasabri/A-completely-new-way-of-discovering-interesting-tweets-/blob/master/README.md)
I created a content-based tweet recommendation system that would allow users to find "similar tweets" starting from any tweet. On the data science side, 
I chose two topics (nightmares, caviar customer complaints), scraped relevant tweets, and used dimensionality reduction (PCA, NMF, ...) and cosine simlarity to recommend similar tweets. On the UX/UI side, I built a clickable prototype to demonstrate the new user experience. </br>
Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, NLTK, Regex, Gensim.

## [Where should Citi Bike build the next 10 bike docks?](https://github.com/riwasabri/Where-should-Citi-Bike-build-the-next-10-bike-docks-)
I combined MTA's station-level traffic data with Citi Bike's ride data to find locations with insufficient docking capacity.<br />
Tools used: SQLite, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Folium.

## [Using the power of data to flip used cars](https://github.com/riwasabri/Using-the-power-of-data-to-flip-used-cars)
I scraped Cars.com's website and then used linear regression to predict car prices and identify underpriced cars.<br />
Tools used: Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodel, Matplotlib,Seaborn

## [Empowering business analysts to understand complex data with interactive dashboards](https://github.com/riwasabri/Empowering-business-analysts-to-understand-complex-data-with-interactive-dashboards)
I transformed Web Analytics data from the Google Merchandise Store, and built dashboards intended to help a business user parse through this complex dataset. I also proposed a clustering approach for better customer targeting..<br />
Tools: Microsoft Excel, Tableau, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## [How can StumbleUpon avoid surfacing stale content?](https://github.com/riwasabri/How-can-StumbleUpon-avoid-surfacing-stale-content-)
I built a classification model to predict whether an article on StumbleUpon is evergreen (timeless) or ephemeral. I optimized the model for precision and did some feature engineering using domain knowledge and TF-IDF. I assessed several models using cross-validation: kNN, Logistic Regression,Random Forest, XGBoost and Ensembling. Through cross-validation, I selected Logistic Regression as the best performing model.</br>
Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
